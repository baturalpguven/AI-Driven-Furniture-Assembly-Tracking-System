# My Amazing Assembly Furniture (MAAF)

## Project Overview
MAAF is designed to detect furniture assembly actions and identify any mistakes in the process. This project offers two distinct solutions to achieve this:

1. **ResNet + LSTM Model**: A robust approach utilizing the well-known ResNet combined with LSTM for sequential data handling.
2. **Custom Lightweight Model**: An efficient, tailor-made model designed for lighter computational loads.

## Features
- **Dual Model Approach**: Choose between a high-performance or a lightweight model based on your system needs.
- **Error Detection**: Automatically detects mistakes during the furniture assembly process.
- **Integration Ready**: Incorporates foundational models like Co-Tracker and DEVA for easy integration and high adaptability.
- **Out-of-the-Box Usage**: Designed for immediate implementation with minimal setup required.

## Resources
- **Model Directories**: Each model has its own directory containing all necessary files and documentation.
- **Visualizations and Analysis**: Explore extensive ablation analyses and demo results in their respective folders.
