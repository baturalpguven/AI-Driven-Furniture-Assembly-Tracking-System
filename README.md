# My Amazing Assembly Furniture (MAAF)

## Project Overview
MAAF is designed to detect furniture assembly actions and identify any mistakes in the process. This project offers two distinct solutions:

1. **ResNet + LSTM Model**: A robust approach that combines ResNet with LSTM for sequential data handling.
2. **Custom Lightweight Model**: A tailored, efficient model designed for lighter computational needs.

## Features
- **Dual Model Approach**: Choose between a high-performance or a lightweight model depending on your system's capabilities.
- **Error Detection**: Automatically detects mistakes during the furniture assembly process.
- **Integration Ready**: Incorporates foundational models like Co-Tracker and DEVA for easy integration and adaptability.
- **User-Friendly**: Designed for immediate implementation with minimal setup required.

## Demo Videos
Below are the demo videos showcasing both models in action:
- [Custom Lightweight Model Demo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/18e07e47-005d-46f5-afdf-0e726cbf265b): This video demonstrates the performance of the lightweight model during assembly.
- [ResNet + LSTM Model Demo with Mistakes](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/549b2f05-0e45-4ae2-a947-fdb1320d820c): This video shows the big model in action, identifying mistakes during the assembly process.

## Resources
- **Model Directories**: Each model has its own directory containing all necessary files and documentation.
- **Visualizations and Analysis**: Extensive ablation analyses and demo results are available in their respective folders.

## Getting Started
